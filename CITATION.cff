### What changed?

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| Long notebook cell with repeated code | Modular functions (`build_model`, `train_and_evaluate`) |
| Hard-coded paths | Central `MODEL_DIR` constant |
| Scattered callbacks | Reusable `callbacks` list |
| Duplicate confusion-matrix code | Packed into helper |
| Mixed plotting / training logic | Clear “main” loop; plots after training |

Push this repo, link it in your paper, and hiring managers / reviewers will see a **clean, reproducible** project instead of ad-hoc notebook cells.
